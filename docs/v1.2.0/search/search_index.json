So all of them, need to be placed under node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] . Attributes (and whole logic of this cookbook) are divided to six sections. Following convention is used: app == node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] so for example app['framework']['adapter'] actually means node['deploy'][<application_shortname>]['framework']['adapter'] . Stack attributes \u00b6 These attributes are used on Stack/Layer level globally to configure the opsworks_ruby cookbook itself. They should'nt be used under node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] (notice lack of the app[] convention). node['applications'] An array of application shortnames which should be deployed to given layer. If set, only applications witch deploy flag set (on OpsWorks side) included in this list will be deployed. If not set, all deploy application will be supported. This parameter mostly matters during the setup phase, since all application in given stack are deployed to the given layer. Using this paramter you can narrow the list to application which you actually intend to use. !!! note Important thing is, that when you try to do a manual deploy from OpsWorks of an application, not included in this list - it will be skipped, as this list takes precedence over anything else. Application attributes \u00b6 global \u00b6 Global parameters apply to the whole application, and can be used by any section (framework, appserver etc.). app['global']['environment'] Type: string Default: production Sets the \"deploy environment\" for all the app-related (for example RAILS_ENV in Rails) actions in the project (server, worker, etc.) app['global']['symlinks'] Note Important Notice: Any values for this parameter will be merged to the defaults Type: key-value Default: { \"system\": \"public/system\", \"assets\": \"public/assets\", \"cache\": \"tmp/cache\", \"pids\": \"tmp/pids\", \"log\": \"log\" } List of symlinks created to the shared directory. The format is {\"shared_path\": \"release_path\"} . For example {\"system\", \"public/system\"} means: Link /src/www/app_name/current/public/system to /src/www/app_name/shared/system . app['global']['create_dirs_before_symlink'] Note Important Notice: Any values for this parameter will be appended to the defaults Type: array Default: [\"tmp\", \"public\", \"config\", \"../../shared/cache\", \"../../shared/assets\"] List of directories to be created before symlinking. Paths are relative to release_path . For example tmp becomes /srv/www/app_name/current/tmp . app['global']['purge_before_symlink'] Note Important Notice: Any values for this parameter will be appended to the defaults Type: array Default: [\"log\", \"tmp/cache\", \"tmp/pids\", \"public/system\", \"public/assets\"] List of directories to be wiped out before symlinking. Paths are relative to release_path . For example tmp becomes /srv/www/app_name/current/tmp . app['global']['rollback_on_error'] Type: boolean Default: true When set to true, any failed deploy will be removed from releases directory. database \u00b6 Those parameters will be passed without any alteration to the database.yml file. Keep in mind, that if you have RDS connected to your OpsWorks application, you don't need to use them. The chef will do all the job, and determine them for you. app['database']['adapter'] Supported values: mariadb , mysql , postgresql , sqlite3 Default: sqlite3 ActiveRecord adapter which will be used for database connection. app['database']['username'] Username used to authenticate to the DB app['database']['password'] Password used to authenticate to the DB app['database']['host'] Database host app['database']['database'] Database name app['database'][<any other>] Any other key-value pair provided here, will be passed directly to the database.yml scm \u00b6 Those parameters can also be determined from OpsWorks application, and usually you don't need to provide them here. Currently only git is supported. app['scm']['scm_provider'] Supported values: git Default: git SCM used by the cookbook to clone the repo. app['scm']['remove_scm_files'] Supported values: true , false Default: true If set to true, all SCM leftovers (like .git ) will be removed. app['scm']['repository'] Repository URL app['scm']['revision'] Branch name/SHA1 of commit which should be use as a base of the deployment. app['scm']['ssh_key'] A private SSH deploy key (the key itself, not the file name), used when fetching repositories via SSH. app['scm']['ssh_wrapper'] A wrapper script, which will be used by git when fetching repository via SSH. Essentially, a value of GIT_SSH environment variable. This cookbook provides one of those scripts for you, so you shouldn't alter this variable unless you know what you're doing. app['scm']['enabled_submodules'] If set to true , any submodules included in the repository, will also be fetched. framework \u00b6 Pre-optimalization for specific frameworks (like migrations, cache etc.). Currently hanami.rb and Rails are supported. app['framework']['adapter'] Supported values: null , hanami , padrino , rails Default: rails Ruby framework used in project. app['framework']['migrate'] Supported values: true , false Default: true If set to true , migrations will be launch during deployment. app['framework']['migration_command'] A command which will be invoked to perform migration. This cookbook comes with predefined migration commands, well suited for the task, and usually you don't have to change this parameter. app['framework']['assets_precompile'] Supported values: true , false Default: true app['framework']['assets_precompilation_command'] A command which will be invoked to precompile assets. padrino \u00b6 For Padrino, slight adjustments needs to be made. Since there are many database adapters supported, instead of creating configuration for each one, the DATABASE_URL environmental variable is provided. You need to parse it in your config/database.rb file and properly pass to the configuration options. For example, for ActiveRecord: database_url = ENV['DATABASE_URL'] && ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionSpecification::ConnectionUrlResolver.new(ENV['DATABASE_URL']).to_hash ActiveRecord::Base.configurations[:production] = database_url || { :adapter => 'sqlite3', :database => Padrino.root('db', 'dummy_app_production.db') } rails \u00b6 app['framework']['envs_in_console'] Warning This is highly unstable feature. If you experience any troubles with deployments, and have this feature enabled, consider disabling it as a first step in your debugging process. Supported values: true , false Default: false If set to true, rails console will be invoked with all application-level environment variables set. appserver \u00b6 Configuration parameters for the ruby application server. Currently Puma , Thin and Unicorn are supported. app['appserver']['adapter'] Default: puma Supported values: puma , thin , unicorn , null Server on the application side, which will receive requests from webserver in front. null means no appserver enabled. app['appserver']['application_yml'] Supported values: true , false Default: false Creates a config/application.yml file with all pre-configured environment variables. Useful for gems like figaro app['appserver']['dot_env'] Supported values: true , false Default: false Creates a .env file with all pre-configured environment variables. Useful for gems like dotenv app['appserver']['preload_app'] Supported values: true , false Default: true Enabling this preloads an application before forking worker processes. app['appserver']['timeout'] Default: 50 Sets the timeout of worker processes to seconds. app['appserver']['worker_processes']| Default: 4 Sets the current number of worker processes. Each worker process will serve exactly one client at a time. unicorn \u00b6 app['appserver']['backlog'] Default: 1024 app['appserver']['delay'] Default: 0.5 app['appserver']['tcp_nodelay'] Supported values: true , false Default: true app['appserver']['tcp_nopush'] Supported values: true , false Default: false app['appserver']['tries'] Default: 5 puma \u00b6 app['appserver']['log_requests'] Supported values: true , false Default: false app['appserver']['thread_max'] Default: 16 app['appserver']['thread_min'] Default: 0 thin \u00b6 app['appserver']['max_connections'] Default: 1024 app['appserver']['max_persistent_connections'] Default: 512 app['appserver']['timeout'] Default: 60 app['appserver']['worker_processes'] Default: 4 webserver \u00b6 Webserver configuration. Proxy passing to application is handled out-of-the-box. Currently Apache2 and nginx is supported. app['webserver']['adapter'] Default: nginx Supported values: apache2 , nginx , null Webserver in front of the instance. It runs on port 80, and receives all requests from Load Balancer/Internet. null means no webserver enabled. app['webserver']['dhparams'] If you wish to use custom generated DH primes, instead of common ones (which is a very good practice), put the contents (not file name) of the dhparams.pem file into this attribute. Read more here. app['webserver']['keepalive_timeout'] Default : 15 The number of seconds webserver will wait for a subsequent request before closing the connection. app['webserver']['ssl_for_legacy_browsers'] Supported values: true , false Default: false By default webserver is configured to follow strict SSL security standards, covered in this article . However, old browsers (like IE < 9 or Android < 2.2) wouldn't work with this configuration very well. If your application needs a support for those browsers, set this parameter to true . apache \u00b6 app['webserver']['extra_config'] Raw Apache2 configuration, which will be inserted into <Virtualhost *:80> section of the application. app['webserver']['extra_config_ssl'] Raw Apache2 configuration, which will be inserted into <Virtualhost *:443> section of the application. If set to true , the extra_config will be copied. app['webserver']['limit_request_body'] Default : 1048576 app['webserver']['log_level'] Default : info app['webserver']['log_dir'] Default : /var/log/apache2 (debian) or /var/log/httpd (rhel) A place to store application-related Apache2 logs. app['webserver']['proxy_timeout'] Default : 60 nginx \u00b6 app['webserver']['build_type'] Supported values: default or source Default: default The way the nginx cookbooks handles nginx installation. Check out the corresponding docs for more details. Never use node['nginx']['install_method'] , as it will be always overwritten by this attribute. app['webserver']['client_body_timeout'] Default: 12 app['webserver']['client_header_timeout'] Default: 12 app['webserver']['client_max_body_size'] Default: 10m app['webserver']['extra_config'] Raw nginx configuration, which will be inserted into server section of the application for HTTP port. app['webserver']['extra_config_ssl'] Raw nginx configuration, which will be inserted into server section of the application for HTTPS port. If set to true , the extra_config will be copied. app['webserver']['log_dir'] Default : /var/log/nginx A place to store application-related nginx logs. app['webserver']['proxy_read_timeout'] Default : 60 app['webserver']['proxy_send_timeout'] Default : 60 app['webserver']['send_timeout'] Default : 10 Since this driver is basically a wrapper for nginx cookbook , you can also configure node['nginx'] attributes as well (notice that node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] logic doesn't apply here.) sidekiq \u00b6 app['worker']['config'] Configuration parameters which will be directly passed to the worker. For example, for sidekiq they will be serialized to sidekiq.yml config file . delayed_job \u00b6 app['worker']['queues'] Array of queues which should be processed by delayed_job resque \u00b6 app['worker']['workers'] Default: 2 Number of resque workers app['worker']['queues'] Default: * Array of queues which should be processed by resque","title":"Attributes"},{"location":"attributes/#attributes","text":"Attributes format follows the guidelines of old Chef 11.x based OpsWorks stack.
