So all of them, need to be placed under node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] . Attributes (and whole logic of this cookbook) are divided to six sections. Following convention is used: app == node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] so for example app['framework']['adapter'] actually means node['deploy'][<application_shortname>]['framework']['adapter'] . Stack attributes \u00b6 These attributes are used on Stack/Layer level globally to configure the opsworks_ruby cookbook itself. They should'nt be used under node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] (notice lack of the app[] convention). node['applications'] An array of application shortnames which should be deployed to given layer. If set, only applications witch deploy flag set (on OpsWorks side) included in this list will be deployed. If not set, all deploy application will be supported. This parameter mostly matters during the setup phase, since all application in given stack are deployed to the given layer. Using this paramter you can narrow the list to application which you actually intend to use. Note Important thing is, that when you try to do a manual deploy from OpsWorks of an application, not included in this list - it will be skipped, as this list takes precedence over anything else. node['ruby-provider'] Note Important please note, that NO compatibility checks for distro/repositories are performed. It's user responsibility to ensure, that given ruby version from given provider can be installed on given platform. For example fullstaq only works on Ubuntu 18.04 platform, installing it on 16.04 will fail. Type: string Default: ruby-ng Supported values: ruby-ng , fullstaq Sets the rubies packages provider. It configures proper apt repository and package namespaces. node['ruby-version'] Note Important please note, that some versions may be available on one system, and not on the other (for example ruby-ng gets freshest versions of ruby way earlier than Amazon Linux). Type: string Default: 3.0 Sets the Ruby version used through the system. For debian-based distributions, a ruby-ng cookbook is used (check ruby-ng cookbook documentation ). For Amazon Linux, packages provided by distribution (i.e. ruby23 , ruby23-devel etc.). node['ruby-variant'] Note Important This option works only when node['ruby-provider'] is set to fullstaq . Type: string Supported values: none, jemalloc , malloctrim Sets ruby variant for given version. node['use-nodejs'] Type: boolean Default: false If enabled, a nodejs and yarn will be installed on a machine, to provide support for webpack and assets precompilation. node['chef-version'] Note Important plase note, that true is hazardous, because it allows uncontrolled upgrade to a potentially major version, i.e. breaking change could occur. Type: integer or boolean Default: false If enabled current chef on OpsWorks will be updated to provided version (if integer provided) or the the latest version (if true ). Patches \u00b6 Chef 12 (which AWS opsworks ruby is based on) is EOL. It uses old libraries and dependencies, which will start be more and more problematic. \"Patches\" section of config is an attempt to workaround this - as long, as it's possible. Note All of those options are set to true by default and it's strongly discouraged to disable them. However if you have any problems with anything those patches touch, disabling them, is a first step to troubleshoot them. node['patches']['chef12_ssl_fix'] Type: boolean Default: true Chef 12 OpenSSL provide very old certificates list - most of them are expired now. This fix, force chef to use more recent list (and valid) list. See Issue #268 for more information. Cross-application attributes \u00b6 These attributes can only be set at the server level; they cannot vary from application to application. webserver \u00b6 node['defaults']['webserver']['remove_default_sites'] Type: array Default: %w[default default.conf 000-default 000-default.conf default-ssl default-ssl.conf] Note : Only applies to Apache2 webserver A list of \"default site\" filenames that should be removed (if they exist) from /etc/{httpd,apache2}/sites-enabled in order to disable any \"default site\" provided by the OS-provided Apache2 package. Set this to nil or an empty array ( [] ) if you want the default site to be enabled. Application attributes \u00b6 global \u00b6 Global parameters apply to the whole application, and can be used by any section (framework, appserver etc.). app['global']['environment'] Type: string Default: production Sets the \"deploy environment\" for all the app-related (for example RAILS_ENV in Rails) actions in the project (server, worker, etc.) app['global']['deploy_dir'] Type: string Default: /srv/www/app_name Determines where the application will be deployed. Note that if you override this setting, you'll typically want to include the short_name in the setting. In other words, this setting doesn't override the /srv/www base directory defafult; it overrides the application-specific /srv/www/app_name default. app['global']['symlinks'] Note Important Notice: Any values for this parameter will be merged to the defaults Type: key-value Default: { \"system\": \"public/system\", \"assets\": \"public/assets\", \"cache\": \"tmp/cache\", \"pids\": \"tmp/pids\", \"log\": \"log\" } List of symlinks created to the shared directory. The format is {\"shared_path\": \"release_path\"} . For example {\"system\", \"public/system\"} means: Link /src/www/app_name/current/public/system to /src/www/app_name/shared/system . app['global']['create_dirs_before_symlink'] Note Important Notice: Any values for this parameter will be appended to the defaults Type: array Default: [\"tmp\", \"public\", \"config\", \"../../shared/cache\", \"../../shared/assets\"] List of directories to be created before symlinking. Paths are relative to release_path . For example tmp becomes /srv/www/app_name/current/tmp . app['global']['purge_before_symlink'] Note Important Notice: Any values for this parameter will be appended to the defaults Type: array Default: [\"log\", \"tmp/cache\", \"tmp/pids\", \"public/system\", \"public/assets\"] List of directories to be wiped out before symlinking. Paths are relative to release_path . For example tmp becomes /srv/www/app_name/current/tmp . app['global']['rollback_on_error'] Type: boolean Default: true When set to true, any failed deploy will be removed from releases directory. app['global']['logrotate_rotate'] Note Important Notice: The parameter is in days Type: integer Default: 30 How many days of logfiles are kept. See Logrotate Attributes for more information on logrotate attribute precedence. app['global']['logrotate_frequency'] Type: string Default: daily Supported values: daily , weekly , monthly , size X How often logrotate runs for the given log(s), either time-based or when the log(s) reach a certain size. See Logrotate Attributes for more information on logrotate attribute precedence. app['global']['logrotate_options'] Type: Array Default: %w[missingok compress delaycompress notifempty copytruncate sharedscripts] All of the unqualified options (i.e., without arguments) that should be enabled for the specified logrotate configuration. See Logrotate Attributes for more information on logrotate attribute precedence. app['global']['logrotate_X'] Type: Varies Any attribute value Y for logrotate_X will cause the logrotate_app resource X to be called with argument Y. For example setting logrotate_cookbook to 'my_cookbook' will result in the logrotate_app resource being invoked with the resource value cookbook 'my_cookbook' . See Logrotate Attributes for more information on logrotate attribute precedence. app['global']['deploy_revision'] Type: boolean Default: false When set to true, deployments will use the deploy_revision provider. The name of a release sub-directory will use a revision identifier rather than a timestamp. See the deploy_revision documentation for more information. database \u00b6 Those parameters will be passed without any alteration to the database.yml file. Keep in mind, that if you have RDS connected to your OpsWorks application, you don\u2019t need to use them. The chef will do all the job, and determine them for you. Note Important Rails 6 introduced multiple database support. This configuration option supports that, by adding extra key to database which is grouping the fields, for example: app['database']['primary']['adapter'] . For backward compatibility old format is also supported. app['database']['adapter'] Supported values: aurora , aurora-postgresql , mariadb , mysql , postgis , postgresql , sqlite3 , null Default: sqlite3 ActiveRecord adapter which will be used for database connection. null means that no database will be configured, and is currently only tested with the rails framework. app['database']['username'] Username used to authenticate to the DB app['database']['password'] Password used to authenticate to the DB app['database']['host'] Database host app['database']['database'] Database name app['database'][<any other>] Any other key-value pair provided here, will be passed directly to the database.yml source \u00b6 Those parameters can also be determined from OpsWorks application, and usually you don't need to provide them here. Currently only git is supported. app['source']['adapter'] Supported values: git , http , s3 Default: git Source used by the cookbook to fetch the application codebase. app['source']['url'] Source code URL (repository URL for SCMs). git \u00b6 app['source']['remove_scm_files'] Supported values: true , false Default: true If set to true, all SCM leftovers (like .git ) will be removed. app['source']['revision'] Branch name/SHA1 of commit which should be use as a base of the deployment. app['source']['ssh_key'] A private SSH deploy key (the key itself, not the file name), used when fetching repositories via SSH. app['source']['ssh_wrapper'] A wrapper script, which will be used by git when fetching repository via SSH. Essentially, a value of GIT_SSH environment variable. This cookbook provides one of those scripts for you, so you shouldn't alter this variable unless you know what you're doing. app['source']['generated_ssh_wrapper'] Default: /tmp/ssh-git-wrapper.sh If the cookbook generates an SSH wrapper for you, this is where it will generate it. For users whose /tmp partitions are mounted noexec (a good security practice to prevent code injection exploits), this attribute allows you to override that location to a partition where execution of the generated shell script is allowed. app['source']['enabled_submodules'] If set to true , any submodules included in the repository, will also be fetched. s3 \u00b6 This source expects a packed project in one of the following formats: bzip2 , compress , gzip , tar , xz or zip . If you are using ubuntu, 7zip is also supported. app['source']['user'] AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID with read access to the bucket. app['source']['password'] AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY for given AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID . http \u00b6 This source expects a packed project in one of the following formats: bzip2 , compress , gzip , tar , xz or zip . If you are using ubuntu, 7zip is also supported. app['source']['user'] If file is hidden behind HTTP BASIC AUTH, this field should contain username. app['source']['password'] If file is hidden behind HTTP BASIC AUTH, this field should contain password. framework \u00b6 Pre-optimalization for specific frameworks (like migrations, cache etc.). Currently hanami.rb and Rails are supported. app['framework']['adapter'] Supported values: null , hanami , padrino , rails Default: rails Ruby framework used in project. app['framework']['migrate'] Supported values: true , false Default: true If set to true , migrations will be launch during deployment. app['framework']['migration_command'] A command which will be invoked to perform migration. This cookbook comes with predefined migration commands, well suited for the task, and usually you don't have to change this parameter. app['framework']['assets_precompile'] Supported values: true , false Default: true app['framework']['assets_precompilation_command'] A command which will be invoked to precompile assets. app['framework']['logrotate_name'] Type: string Default: Depends on adapter-specific behaviors The name of the logrotate_app resource, and generated configuration file, for the specified app framework logrotate configuration. Unlike other logrotate attributes, this attribute can only be set or overridden at a the app framework level; there are no app-wide or global settings beyond those provided by the framework library app['framework']['logrotate_log_paths'] Type: Array Default: Depends on adapter-specific behaviors Which log file(s) should be backed up via logrotate. If this parameter evaluates to an empty array, no logs will be backed up for the specified app framework. Unlike other logrotate attributes, this attribute can only be set or overridden at a the app framework level; there are no app-wide or global settings beyond those provided by the framework library. padrino \u00b6 For Padrino, slight adjustments needs to be made. Since there are many database adapters supported, instead of creating configuration for each one, the DATABASE_URL environmental variable is provided. You need to parse it in your config/database.rb file and properly pass to the configuration options. For example, for ActiveRecord: database_url = ENV['DATABASE_URL'] && ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionSpecification::ConnectionUrlResolver.new(ENV['DATABASE_URL']).to_hash ActiveRecord::Base.configurations[:production] = database_url || { :adapter => 'sqlite3', :database => Padrino.root('db', 'dummy_app_production.db') } rails \u00b6 app['framework']['envs_in_console'] Warning This is highly unstable feature. If you experience any troubles with deployments, and have this feature enabled, consider disabling it as a first step in your debugging process. Supported values: true , false Default: false If set to true, rails console will be invoked with all application-level environment variables set. appserver \u00b6 Configuration parameters for the ruby application server. Currently Puma , Thin , Unicorn and Passenger are supported. app['appserver']['adapter'] Default: puma Supported values: puma , thin , unicorn , passenger , null Server on the application side, which will receive requests from webserver in front. null means no appserver enabled. app['appserver']['application_yml'] Supported values: true , false Default: false Creates a config/application.yml file with all pre-configured environment variables. Useful for gems like figaro app['appserver']['dot_env'] Supported values: true , false Default: false Creates a .env file with all pre-configured environment variables. Useful for gems like dotenv app['appserver']['preload_app'] Supported values: true , false Default: true Enabling this preloads an application before forking worker processes. app['appserver']['timeout'] Default: 50 Sets the timeout of worker processes to seconds. app['appserver']['worker_processes']| Default: 4 Sets the current number of worker processes. Each worker process will serve exactly one client at a time. app['appserver']['passenger_version'] Default: None Which Debian APT package version should be installed from the PPA repo provided by Passenger. Currently this defaults to the latest version provided by the Passenger APT PPA. Set this to a non-nil value to lock your Passenger installation at a specific version. app['appserver']['port'] Default: None Bind the appserver to a port on 0.0.0.0. This is useful for serving the application directly from the appserver without a web server middleware or separating the web server into its own container or server. This can also be used for running multiple applications on a server when using apache as your webserver. unicorn \u00b6 app['appserver']['backlog'] Default: 1024 app['appserver']['delay'] Default: 0.5 app['appserver']['tcp_nodelay'] Supported values: true , false Default: true app['appserver']['tcp_nopush'] Supported values: true , false Default: false app['appserver']['tries'] Default: 5 puma \u00b6 app['appserver']['log_requests'] Supported values: true , false Default: false app['appserver']['thread_max'] Default: 16 app['appserver']['thread_min'] Default: 0 app['appserver']['on_restart'] Code to run before doing a restart. This code should close log files, database connections, etc. app['appserver']['before_fork'] Code to run immediately before the master starts workers. app['appserver']['on_worker_boot'] Code to run in a worker before it starts serving requests. This is called everytime a worker is to be started. app['appserver']['on_worker_shutdown'] Code to run in a worker right before it exits. This is called everytime a worker is to about to shutdown. app['appserver']['on_worker_fork'] Code to run in the master right before a worker is started. The worker's index is passed as an argument. This is called everytime a worker is to be started. app['appserver']['after_worker_fork'] Code to run in the master after a worker has been started. The worker's index is passed as an argument. This is called everytime a worker is to be started. thin \u00b6 app['appserver']['max_connections'] Default: 1024 app['appserver']['max_persistent_connections'] Default: 512 app['appserver']['timeout'] Default: 60 app['appserver']['worker_processes'] Default: 4 passenger \u00b6 app['appserver']['max_pool_size'] Type: Integer Default: Passenger-provided default (based on server capacity) Sets the PassengerMaxPoolSize parameter app['appserver']['min_instances'] Type: Integer Default: Passenger-provided default (based on server capacity) Sets the PassengerMinInstances parameter app['appserver']['mount_point'] Default: / Which URL path should be handled by Passenger. This option allows you to configure your application to handle only a subset of requests made to your web server. Useful for certain hybrid static/dynamic web sites. app['appserver']['pool_idle_time'] Type: Integer Default: 300 Sets the PoolIdleTime parameter app['appserver']['max_request_queue_size'] Type: Integer Default: 100 Sets the MaxRequestQueueSize parameter app['appserver']['error_document'] Type: Hash Default: off Sets the { \"status\": \"file\" } parameter e.g. { \"500\": \"500.html\", \"503\": \"503.html\" } app['appserver']['passenger_max_preloader_idle_time'] Type: Integer Default: 300 Sets the PassengerMaxPreloaderIdleTime parameter webserver \u00b6 Webserver configuration. Proxy passing to application is handled out-of-the-box. Currently Apache2 and nginx is supported. app['webserver']['adapter'] Default: nginx Supported values: apache2 , nginx , null Webserver in front of the instance. It runs on port 80 by default (see app['webserver']['port'] ), and receives all requests from the Load Balancer/Internet. null means no webserver enabled. app['webserver']['dhparams'] If you wish to use custom generated DH primes, instead of common ones (which is a very good practice), put the contents (not file name) of the dhparams.pem file into this attribute. Read more here. app['webserver']['keepalive_timeout'] Default : 15 The number of seconds webserver will wait for a subsequent request before closing the connection. app['webserver']['ssl_for_legacy_browsers'] Supported values: true , false Default: false By default webserver is configured to follow strict SSL security standards, covered in this article . However, old browsers (like IE < 9 or Android < 2.2) wouldn't work with this configuration very well. If your application needs a support for those browsers, set this parameter to true . app['webserver']['port'] Default 80 The port on which the webserver should listen for HTTP requests. app['webserver']['ssl_port'] Default 443 The port on which the webserver should listen for HTTPs requests, if SSL requests are enabled. Note that SSL itself is controlled by the app['enable_ssl'] setting in Opsworks. app['webserver']['force_ssl'] Supported values: true , false Default false When this parameter is set to true all requests passed to http will be redirected to https, with 301 status code. This works only when SSL in OpsWorks panel is enabled, otherwise it's ommited. app['webserver']['site_config_template'] Default appserver.apache2.conf.erb or appserver.nginx.conf.erb The name of the cookbook template that should be used to generate per-app configuration stanzas (known as a \"site\" in apache and nginx configuration parlance). Useful in situations where inserting an extra_config text section doesn't provide enough flexibility to customize your per-app webserver configuration stanza to your liking. Note that when you use a custom site configuration template, you can also choose to define extra_config as any data structure (e.g., Hash or even nested Hash) to be interpreted by your custom template. This provides somewhat unlimited flexibility to configure the webserver app configuration however you see fit. app['webserver']['site_config_template_cookbook'] Default opsworks_ruby The name of the cookbook in which the site configuration template can be found. If you override app['webserver']['site_config_template'] to use a site configuration template from your own cookbook, you'll need to override this setting as well to ensure that the opsworks_ruby cookbook looks for the specified template in your cookbook. app['webserver']['logrotate_name'] Type: string Default: Depends on adapter-specific behaviors The name of the logrotate_app resource, and generated configuration file, for the specified app webserver logrotate configuration. Unlike other logrotate attributes, this attribute can only be set or overridden at a the app webserver level; there are no app-wide or global settings beyond those provided by the webserver library app['webserver']['logrotate_log_paths'] Type: Array Default: Depends on adapter-specific behaviors Which log file(s) should be backed up via logrotate. If this parameter evaluates to an empty array, no logs will be backed up for the specified app webserver. Unlike other logrotate attributes, this attribute can only be set or overridden at a the app webserver level; there are no app-wide or global settings beyond those provided by the webserver library apache \u00b6 app['webserver']['extra_config'] Raw Apache2 configuration, which will be inserted into <Virtualhost *:80> (or other port, if specified) section of the application. app['webserver']['extra_config_ssl'] Raw Apache2 configuration, which will be inserted into <Virtualhost *:443> (or other port, if specified for SSL) section of the application. If set to true , the extra_config will be copied. app['webserver']['limit_request_body'] Default : 1048576 app['webserver']['log_level'] Default : info app['webserver']['log_dir'] Default : /var/log/apache2 (debian) or /var/log/httpd (rhel) A place to store application-related Apache2 logs. app['webserver']['proxy_timeout'] Default : 60 nginx \u00b6 app['webserver']['build_type'] Supported values: default or source Default: default The way the nginx cookbooks handles nginx installation. Check out the corresponding docs for more details. Never use node['nginx']['install_method'] , as it will be always overwritten by this attribute. app['webserver']['client_body_timeout'] Default: 12 app['webserver']['client_header_timeout'] Default: 12 app['webserver']['client_max_body_size'] Default: 10m app['webserver']['extra_config'] Raw nginx configuration, which will be inserted into server section of the application for HTTP port. app['webserver']['extra_config_ssl'] Raw nginx configuration, which will be inserted into server section of the application for HTTPS port. If set to true , the extra_config will be copied. app['webserver']['log_dir'] Default : /var/log/nginx A place to store application-related nginx logs. app['webserver']['proxy_read_timeout'] Default : 60 app['webserver']['proxy_send_timeout'] Default : 60 app['webserver']['send_timeout'] Default : 10 app['webserver']['enable_upgrade_method'] Supported values: true , false Default : false When set to true, enable Websocket's upgrade method such as Rails actionCable. Since this driver is basically a wrapper for nginx cookbook , you can also configure node['nginx'] attributes as well (notice that node['deploy'][<application_shortname>] logic doesn't apply here.) worker \u00b6 Worker configuration. Currently sidekiq, delayed_job, resque, shoryuken. app['webserver']['adapter'] Default: null Supported values: sidekiq , delayed_job , resque , shoryuken and null . If worker is needed, here it can be set up and configured. null means no worker installed. app['worker']['monit_template_cookbook'] Default opsworks_ruby The name of the cookbook from which the worker monit template(s) will be drawn. sidekiq \u00b6 app['worker']['config'] Configuration parameters which will be directly passed to the worker. For example, for sidekiq they will be serialized to sidekiq.yml config file . delayed_job \u00b6 app['worker']['queues'] Array of queues which should be processed by delayed_job resque \u00b6 app['worker']['workers'] Default: 2 Number of resque workers app['worker']['queues'] Default: * Array of queues which should be processed by resque shoryuken \u00b6 app['worker']['config'] Configuration parameters which will be directly passed to the worker. For example, for shoryuken they will be serialized to the relevant shoryuken.yml config file . app['worker']['process_count'] Default: 1 Number of shoryuken runner daemons to start. Shoryuken is multithreaded, so defaults to 1. app['worker']['require'] Path to require, relative to the currently deployed application directory. app['worker']['require_rails'] Supported values: true , false Default : false Emits -R to require the rails environment on boot. app['worker']['syslog'] Supported values: true , false Default : false Configures piping shoryuken runner log output to syslog via logger Logrotate Attributes \u00b6 Logrotate behaviors occur across multiple drivers, for example webserver and framework. For this reason, the evaluation order for attribute-driven behaviors is a bit more complex for logrotate than for other options that are either entirely global (for example, global.environment ) or entirely isolated to a single type of driver ( webserver.keepalive_timeout ). The evaluation rules for logrotate setting X are as follows, from highest priority to lowest priority: app[driver_type]['logrotate_X'] app['global']['logrotate_X'] node['defaults'][driver_type]['logrotate_X'] node['defaults']['global']['logrotate_X']","title":"Attributes"},{"location":"attributes/#attributes","text":"Attributes format follows the guidelines of old Chef 11.x based OpsWorks stack.

If you have a working instances which were relying on that, you have to either set app['appserver']['adapter'] = 'unicorn' in your stack/layer JSON file, or switch the app server in your application webserver: sites-available and sites-enabled file names format changed. From this commit, the *.conf extension is appended. If you plan to update your cookbooks on productional environments, don't forget to remove the old ones, otherwise you will end up with two the same configurations in different files, which cause nginx to fail. If you start noticing duplicate upstream errors, this is probably due this case. 0.8.0 (2016-09-02) \u00b6 Bug Fixes \u00b6 Switched from nginx reload to nginx restart after succesful deploy/undeploy ( 16ab9d1 ), closes #36 Features \u00b6 Added GIT_SSH support for bundle install ( 232e8ac ), closes #37 Caches bundler installs to speed up deployments ( baa0f44 ) Implemented configurable RAILS_ENV ( 2567b71 ), closes #34 0.7.0 (2016-08-29) \u00b6 Bug Fixes \u00b6 Moved extra env files creation, later in the stack (before_restart) ( 8a5223f ) Reload monit after restarting services ( eaa2aab ) Set the default DB adapter to sqlite3 ( b4b1ee4 ) specify bundle path on bundle install ( b9d4335 ) Features \u00b6 Added support for gems like figaro and dotenv ( c989494 ), closes #28 0.6.0 (2016-08-17) \u00b6 BREAKING CHANGES \u00b6 Removed application_ruby cookbook dependency 0.5.0 (2016-07-21) \u00b6 Features \u00b6 Added configuration for isolated worker servers w/o app/webserver ( 56642f1 ) Added monit compatibility with amazon linux ( 2ef12b9 ) 0.4.0 (2016-06-16) \u00b6 Features \u00b6 Enables drivers to be attached to before_ and after_ deploy events ( fa8e605 ) 0.3.1 (2016-06-16) \u00b6 Bug Fixes \u00b6 Change path to 500.html to be in the \"current\" dir ( 4aeac7f ) Support for multiple RDSes with multiple applications ( a23df47 ) 0.3.0 (2016-06-08) \u00b6 Features \u00b6 eliminate RDS requirement ( daa4254 ) BREAKING CHANGES \u00b6 Sqlite3 is no longer set as the default database adapter.
